# Monthly-Playlist-Spotify
A little tool that automatically sorts every song you liked in a specific month into a neat playlist of that month.

## API Logic
- Never touch already existing playlists
- User should select for themselves how many monthly playlists they want to create at once

## General Logic
- No userdata should be saved. Everything should happen locally.
